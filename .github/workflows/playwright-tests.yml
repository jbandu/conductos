  # Note: Full tests use API mocks and are designed for local development.
  # They test UI behavior with mocked API responses, not the real Railway deployment.
  # Run full tests locally with: npm test
  #
  # To enable full E2E tests against Railway, we would need:
  # 1. Test user accounts on Railway
  # 2. Tests rewritten without mocks
  # 3. Test data seeding/cleanup strategies
